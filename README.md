# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Sales Dataset

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Visualization** using Python.  
The analysis helps uncover patterns, trends, and insights from a retail sales dataset.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains sales transaction details including:
- Order and shipping information
- Customer and regional data
- Product categories and sub-categories
- Sales, profit, quantity, and discount metrics

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The following steps were performed:
- Removed blank and duplicate records
- Converted date columns to datetime format
- Assigned appropriate data types to numerical and categorical columns
- Standardized text fields for consistency

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key EDA tasks include:
- Summary statistics using `describe()`
- Category-wise and region-wise sales & profit analysis
- Identification of top and bottom performing categories
- Correlation analysis between Sales, Profit, Discount, and Quantity

---

## 📈 Data Visualization
The following visualizations were created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
- Bar chart for category-wise sales
- Line chart showing sales trend over time
- Histogram for sales distribution and profit distribution
- Scatter plot for discount vs profit relationship

2. Monthly Sales Trend Visualization

- Extracted Year and Month from the Order Date to enable time-based grouping.
- Grouped data by Year and Month and aggregated total monthly sales.
- Plotted year-wise monthly sales trends using a line chart.
- This visualization helps identify seasonal patterns and compare performance across different years.


## 💡 Insights
The analysis highlights:
- High-performing product sub-categories
- Impact of discounts on profitability
- Seasonal patterns in sales trends
